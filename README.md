# ML_Project-Customer_Segmentation

**Customer Segmentation using the RFM Model and K-Means Clustering**

In today's competitive retail environment, UK online stores need help to retain existing customers and personalize marketing efforts. This project addresses this challenge by developing a customer segmentation model using RFM analysis and K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior. This will enable targeted marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and retention.

## Steps Involved:
1. Define Problem Statement
2. Collect Data
3. Load Dataset
4. Perform EDA
5. Data Preprocessing
6. KMeans Clustering Model Building
7. Conclusion

This project implemented customer segmentation using the RFM Model and K-means Clustering on a UK online retail store's transaction data. The analysis resulted in three distinct customer clusters: `Cluster 0, Cluster 1, and Cluster 2`. Notably, Cluster 0 exhibited the highest revenue generation, while Cluster 2 demonstrated the lowest.

Customer segmentation proves to be a powerful tool for gaining business insights into customer behavior. The `Silhouette Index score of 0.45` indicates a good separation between the clusters within this dataset.


**`Key takeaways from the analysis:`**


`Cluster 1:` These customers are likely `loyal advocates`, **exhibiting recent purchases, **high purchase frequency**, and significant total spending. They represent a valuable customer segment for nurturing strong relationships.

`Cluster 0:` This cluster likely consists of at-risk customers or those `prone to churn`. They demonstrate **low recent purchase activity, infrequent purchases, and lower total spending compared to other clusters**. Targeted marketing campaigns aimed at re-engagement may be beneficial for this group.

**`Benefits of Customer Segmentation:`**

Customer segmentation offers several advantages that can significantly improve business strategies. Here are some key benefits:

* **Targeted Marketing:** By understanding customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns to specific groups, increasing campaign effectiveness.
* **Improved Customer Relationships:** Segmentation allows for personalized interactions and promotions, fostering stronger customer relationships.
* **Enhanced Customer Retention:** Identifying high-value customers or at-risk customers allows for targeted efforts to improve retention.

By leveraging customer segmentation, businesses gain valuable insights into their customer base, enabling them to develop targeted strategies that enhance customer experience, drive sales, and ultimately lead to increased profitability.
